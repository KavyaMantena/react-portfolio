      <p>
        Howdy, I am Kavya, a dentist by profession, born in India, raised in
        India and California, and moved to Austin when I married the love of my
        life. Aspiring to become a web developer, I have stepped into this new
        career path. Eager to learn and grow higher and higher in this new
        technology field. I love to cook, play badminton, binge-watch Netflix
        series, and of course, who doesn't love to spend time with their family.
        Check out my projects and contact me for more information
